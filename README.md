# expose loader for webpack

The expose loader adds modules to the global object. This is useful
for debugging, or supporting libraries that depend on libraries in
globals.

**Note**: Modules must be `require()`'d within in your bundle, or they will not
be exposed.

## Usage

``` javascript
require("expose-loader?libraryName!./file.js");
// Exposes the exports for file.js to the global context on property "libraryName".
// In web browsers, window.libraryName is then available.
```

This line works to expose React to the web browser to enable the Chrome React devtools:

```
require("expose-loader?React!react");
```

Thus, `window.React` is then available to the Chrome React devtools extension.

Alternately, you can set this in your config file:

```
module: {
  loaders: [
    { test: require.resolve("react"), loader: "expose-loader?React" }
  ]
}
```
Also for multiple expose you can use `!` in loader string:
```
module: {
  loaders: [
    { test: require.resolve("jquery"), loader: "expose-loader?$!expose-loader?jQuery" },
  ]
}
```
Also for auto-expose all modules(maybe for debug) you can use `[name]` or another placeholders
```
module: {
  loaders: [
    { test: /\.js$/, loader: "expose?[name]" },
  ]
}
```

The `require.resolve` is a node.js call (unrelated to `require.resolve` in webpack
processing -- check the node.js docs instead). `require.resolve` gives you the
absolute path to the module ("/.../app/node_modules/react/react.js"). So the
expose only applies to the react module. And it's only exposed when used in the
bundle.
